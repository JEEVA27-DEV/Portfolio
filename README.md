# Portfolio
This project is a fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to highlight my technical skills, projects, and achievements. It features a modern UI with smooth navigation, interactive elements, and a mobile-first layout. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and hosted on GitHub Pages for seamless deployment.
